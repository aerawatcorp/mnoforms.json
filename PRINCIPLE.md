## Founder's Vision: Real world ideology of Modular Systems

The Datacables schema is heavily influenced by the founder's belief in promoting loosely coupled and asynchronous communication within software systems.

**Core Principle: Modular Design**

* Each component (schema) acts as a black box, isolated from others.
* Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces.

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Maintainability:** Changes in one module have minimal impact on others, making maintenance easier.
* **Scalability:** Independent modules facilitate easier system growth and modification.
* **Testability:** Modules can be tested in isolation, simplifying the testing process.
* **Reusability:** Well-defined modules can be reused across different projects.

**Inspiration and Real-World Parallels**

The founder's belief aligns with the "Dependency Inversion Principle" from Clean Code Architecture, which promotes unidirectional dependencies (high-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level ones). This philosophy reflects how the real world often operates in near perfect isolation and asynchronous communication.

Consider these examples:

- **Cloud Kitchen Food Order:** The person taking the order doesn't necessarily cook and deliver it themselves. Each step (taking the order, cooking, delivery) functions independently on its own timeline, demonstrating the efficiency of decentralized and asynchronous processes.
- **Sun, Clouds, and Rain:** Imagine if sunshine had to wait for a specific cloud formation before appearing, or rain had to be delivered directly by the sun. The real world operates with a beautiful interplay of independent systems – the sun provides energy, clouds gather moisture, and rain falls – all on their own cycles, showcasing the power of asynchronous and loosely coupled processes.

Overall, the founder's vision for modular systems prioritizes loose coupling and asynchronous communication, fostering improved maintainability, scalability, and reusability.
